# Cristian Villatoro

My personal academic website, hosted at [cristianvill.github.io](https://cristianvill.github.io)

## About

I'm a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Notre Dame, working on multi-fidelity neural networks and uncertainty quantification. This site hosts my research, publications, and teaching information.

It also includes a cooking section—because sometimes the best way to think through a difficult problem is to step away from the terminal and into the kitchen.

## Features

- **Academic portfolio**: Research, publications, teaching, CV
- **Cooking section**: Recipes and food writing ("From Cocina Humilde to Cucina Povera")
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Clean, modern aesthetic**: Professional but approachable

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Font Awesome for icons (optional)
- Minimal dependencies for fast loading

## Using This Template

Feel free to fork this repo and adapt it for your own academic website. The design is intentionally simple and easy to customize:

1. Update personal information in `index.html`
2. Modify colors in `styles.css` (see CSS variables at the top)
3. Add your own content (publications, recipes, etc.)
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

The cooking section is entirely optional—you can remove it or repurpose it for any secondary interest (photography, music, writing, etc.).

## Design Philosophy

The main site has a warm, professional aesthetic that avoids the sterile "academic blue" look. The cooking section intentionally shifts to warmer tones and a more casual voice, creating a clear contrast between the two sides of the site.

Both sections are built with the idea that academic websites should be human—we're more than just our CVs.

## License

Feel free to use this template for your own website. No attribution required, though it's appreciated.
