A creamy, umami-rich risotto where technique and ingredient quality shine.

## Portioning Guide

Rice: 80–100g Arborio rice per serving  
Mushrooms: ~1 mushroom per 20g of rice (e.g., 5 mushrooms for 100g rice)  
Broth: Enough to give multiple "broth baths" — keep extra on hand, warm (not boiling)

## Instructions

Toast the black pepper in a pan over medium/medium-low heat until fragrant.

Add the rice and toast until the grains are translucent and nutty-smelling.

Add sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt. Cook until they release their water. You'll know they're done when the pan starts to sizzle again. A lid can speed things up. (Cremini is classic, but use what's good.)

Add shallots, then olive oil. Stir gently and cook until shallots are translucent.

Deglaze with white wine. Stir to coat everything and scrape any fond from the pan. Wait for the alcohol to burn off — you'll smell floral notes.

Start broth baths: Add warm (not boiling) broth until it covers the mixture about 3/4 of the way. Stir to distribute liquid evenly. Avoid adding cold broth — it slows cooking and dulls texture.

When the rice is drying and the pan sizzles, add more broth. Repeat this cycle. After a few baths, the rice will puff up. At this point, taste before each addition to check if it's nearing al dente.

Once nearly or just at al dente, add a bit more broth to keep it wet. Take off the heat.

Stir in butter, then grated Pecorino Romano. Add cheese gradually until you see tiny cheesy strings when stirring. That's your creamy finish.

## Tips

- Pecorino gives more punch than Parmigiano — adjust to your taste.
- The goal is creamy and glossy, not soupy.
- Ingredient quality matters most for: rice, mushrooms, broth, and olive oil.
